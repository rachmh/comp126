      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>Babe Haven is a high energy queer punk band that riots in Durham, NC. With a mission to elevate femme-presenting individuals, people of color, and members of the LGBTQ+ community, they transform each show into a sanctuary of empowerment and acceptance.</p>
      <p>Babe Haven has quickly become a DIY staple of the Southeast. The members include Naomi Poesel (guitar/ vocals), Lillie Della Penna (lead vocals), Brendan Martini (drums) and Julia Lynn (bass). Babe Haven has a few releases under their belt like their self titled EP, “Babe Haven” and two full-length albums "Uppercut" and "Nuisance."</p>
